    <p>
      I graduated from school in 2016 and started studying in Ort Braude right
      away, My field of study back then was electronics and electrecity, <br />
      I left this field after a while because I discovered that I'm more "me"
      when I had my programming courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year after I started studying Software engineering in the same college.
      <br />
      I finished in 2020 with an degree avarage of 82, I presented my end
      project a year after. <br />
      Then I joined the Army on the 2nd of february 2022 (remarkable date).
